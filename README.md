# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Instructions
In the 'notebooks' folder you will find two notebooks: 'screener.ipynd' and 'model.ipynb'. The screener is a program that gets some up-to-date financials for a few stocks. This data is saved to '/data/screener_results'

The 'model.ipynb' notebook is a work in progress machine learning model that works with a scraper, which scrapes over 2000 stocks historical data, and tries to predict the price change for the next quarter.
